# Stock-Price-Prediction-System
I developed a Stock Price Prediction System in Java to enhance my skills in data structures and algorithms (DSA). This project analyzes historical stock data to predict future profits or losses. It features an intuitive interface for data input, efficient daily profit/loss computation, and future profit prediction based on trends.
